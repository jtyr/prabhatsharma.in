With AWS releasing myriad of services and features every week how do you even get to know what got released and what is relevant to you. On top of the new services/features getting released there are a lot of blogs that get released by AWS solution architects and engineers that provide useful instructions to achieve specific use cases.

I will point you to specific RSS feeds that you can use to staty updated.

Before you can begin you will need an RSS feedreader that can notify you whenever anything new becomes available from AWS. Officially not all RSS feeds seem to be publicized from AWS but you can always get the feeds by hitting the URLs directly. I will share the links below that you can use.

I am on Mac and the RSS feedreader I use is [**Luck News**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lucknews/id590365026?mt=12)

The most important RSS feeds from AWS are:

<table class="table table-striped">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>#</th>
            <th>Feed</th>
            <th>Feed URL</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>1.</td>
            <td><a href='https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/recent/'>What's new</a></td>
            <td><a href='https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/recent/feed'>https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/recent/feed</a> </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2.</td>
            <td><a href='https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/recent/'>AWS News Blog</a></td>
            <td><a href='https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/feed/'>https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/feed/</a> </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

You also have blogs specific to domains that you might be interested in:
