With AWS releasing myriad of services and features every week how do you even get to know what got released and what is relevant to you. On top of the new services/features getting released there are a lot of blogs that get released by AWS solution architects and engineers that provide useful instructions to achieve specific use cases.

I will point you to specific RSS feeds that you can use to staty updated.

Before you can begin you will need an RSS feedreader that can notify you whenever anything new becomes available from AWS.

I am on MAc and my favorite RSS feedreader is **Luck News** [**Luck News**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lucknews/id590365026?mt=12)
